**4 non-(highz)-quasar**: [NIRES_2204_tellcorr.pdf](../plot/NIRES_2204_tellcorr.pdf). dwarf template could help.

**J1007+2115**: Known $z\sim 7.52$ quasar (also in [NIRES_2204_tellcorr.pdf](../plot/NIRES_2204_tellcorr.pdf))

**J1539-0203 and J1557+0140**: too faint, no 1d spec is subtracted. according to observation note they don't look like quasars. I tried to lower the snr threshold but still cannot detect the traces.

**J2212+2040**: no LRIS flux, we inspect the LRIS-NIRES-MOSFIRE spectrum [J2212_LRIS_NIRES_MOSFIRE](../../J2212/J2212_LRIS%2BMOSFIRE%2BNIRES.pdf) of this target, could be BAL? Also looks extended in 2022 FIRE observation (Feige & Jinyi). Nature still inconclusive?
