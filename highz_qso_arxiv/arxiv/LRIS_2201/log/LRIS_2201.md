**16 non-quasar**: among them many seem to be dwarf, we should set up a scheme to classify them primitively. Some features of dwarfs: absorption lines (e.g. $\rm TiO$ and $\rm H_2O$; be careful about the terresitial absorption) and gradual decline shape (since they peak in IR). Some of them might be quite obvious, see spectrum in ``plot``; Two of coadd2d (three in total) turn out to be non-qso, but show the same emission feature $\sim 7900 \AA$. Could them be another type of imposter other than brown dwarf?

**J0820+2412**: wrong target (true target unobserverd)

**J1145+0933**: no flux in LRIS (see spectrum and noise plot in ``plot``)
