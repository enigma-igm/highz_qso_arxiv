**24 non-quasar**: 23 of them have reduced 1d spectrum, see [LRIS_2204_tellcorr.pdf](../plot/LRIS_2204_tellcorr.pdf). For **J0854**, we coadd2d but still the trace is too faint. But it doesn't look like a quasar from the 2d. 

**3 quasars**: 2 Riccardo's targets (J1319+0101: $z\sim 5.7$ and J0901+2906: $z\sim 6.1$); 2 Eduardo's targets (J1458+1012: $z\sim 5.6$ and J1724+3718: $z\sim 5.74$)

**J2212+2040**: inconclusive, later observed with FIRE (extender?)

**J0744+2352**: reduction failed; slit both sides off; faint

**J1100+0237**: reduction failed; slit both sides off; doesn't look like a quasar 

**J1432+0015**: reduction failed; slit both sides off; doesn't look like a quasar 

**J1152+0059**: reduction failed; bright central source

**J1423+2901**: reduction failed; bright offset
