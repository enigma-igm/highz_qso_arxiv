**5 non-(highz)-quasar**: [MOSFIRE_2201_tellcorr.pdf](../plot/MOSFIRE_2201_tellcorr.pdf). see flux above $9800\AA$. some of them might be LRIS targets, see ``.csv`` and ``plot``.

**J0854+2908**: spectrum in ``plot`` might not be the target as it is too bright (in [MOSFIRE_2201_tellcorr.pdf](../plot/MOSFIRE_2201_tellcorr.pdf)). Offset star should also be in the 2d spectrum. If the "bright" source is the offset (faint if it's offset; $\rm J_{AB}=18.52784$), then the real target cannot be seen in the 2d.

**J0855+2759**: there is note in the observation log indicating that it has been observed, but there is no data for it in KOA.

**J0730+5949**: cannot see target in 2d coadd. no spectrum produced. bad weather? **inconclusive**

**J1506+3316**: two traces near the position of target. both are faint. **inconclusive**
