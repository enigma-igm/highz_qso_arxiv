## Introduction: high-z quasar arxiv

- list of the archived observation runs 
- explain the candidate selection method, color cuts and Riccardo's method
- why high-z quasar
- difficulty (contaminants)

## Telescope Info

- LRIS / MOSFIRE / NIRES. Their wavelength coverages and corresponding redshifts (a plot here, throughput?)
- Telescope specifications (e.g. LRIS has dichroic, NIRES cross dispersed orders)

## Contaminants

- low-z SF galaxies / dwarfs (explain why they could be contaminants, perhaps with some templates)

## Project Goals

- a list of non-qso for future reference
- any qso we miss? (unfortunately no)
- learn about the contaminants 
- refine obs stragetgy

## Data Reduction

- What Pypeit is doing? (apply gain->subtract overscan->trim->orient->subtract bias->subtract dark->spatial flexure shift->flatfield)
- Telescope specifications (e.g. for two IR instruments, we do dithering)
  
this part need to be more eye-catching (dont need to much technical details)

## Current Status of the catalog construction

- use some screenshots and plots from the repository

## Side Quests

- ACQ photometry for MOSFIRE
- quasar simulation

One plot for each quest for display purpose
