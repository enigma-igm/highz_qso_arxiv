J0105_3237 - trace too faint
J0112-3234 - need to recheck the data reduction but it seems not a QSO
J0128-3236 - need to look at the 1D combined spectrum as it might be a QSO
J0201-2927 - need to look at the 1D combined spectrum but the trace is faint and it doesn't look like a QSO
J0210-2844 - likely not a QSO but faint trace
J0216-2907 - likely not a QSO but faint trace
J0222-0451 - I don't see a trace but they say they are not sure they got the right target on slit
J0302-3518 - need to recheck the data reduction but I don't see a trace
J0323-2844 - need to look at the 1D spectrum as it might be a QSO, however the second 2D spectrum lay in the trace of the bright star
J0835+0209 - I don't see a trace
J0836+0217 - trace is detected but very faint, I should look at the 1D spec
J0850+0214 - need to look at the 1D combined spectrum but it doesn't look like a QSO
J0851-0010 - I can see a faint trace but the object is not detected. Need to change the detection parmeters and see if I can extract a 1D spectrum
